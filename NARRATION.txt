CONFIDENTIAL GAMING SCORE - 1 MINUTE VIDEO NARRATION
====================================================

SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION

Introducing Confidential Gaming Score - a comprehensive hub for building privacy-preserving smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on the FHEVM blockchain.

Gaming platforms today face a critical challenge: player scores are exposed on public blockchains, compromising privacy and enabling unfair competition.

What if you could build a gaming system where scores remain completely encrypted - where no one, not even the smart contract owner, can see individual player performance?

That's the power of FHE - Fully Homomorphic Encryption. It allows computation on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.


SCENE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT

Traditional gaming leaderboards expose everything. Player scores are visible to everyone - competitors, observers, even malicious actors.

This breaks privacy, enables cheating, and prevents anonymous competition.

Players want to compete without revealing their real-world identity or performance metrics.

Developers need a secure way to build gaming applications that respect player privacy while maintaining fair competition mechanics.


SCENE 3: FHEVM SOLUTION

This is where FHEVM comes in. Our Confidential Gaming Score project demonstrates how to build completely private gaming systems.

Scores are encrypted when submitted. They remain encrypted throughout all computation - storage, comparison, ranking.

Only the player who submitted their score can decrypt it using their private keys.

The smart contract can perform complex operations on encrypted data using FHE operations - comparing scores, calculating rankings, awarding achievements - all without exposing sensitive information.

Look at the code. Here we encrypt a score using FHE.asEuint32. We perform encrypted comparisons with FHE.gt. We grant permissions to both the contract and the user. This is production-grade privacy on the blockchain.


SCENE 4: PROJECT FEATURES

Our submission includes three complete, production-ready examples:

Confidential Gaming Score - a full gaming achievement system with encrypted leaderboards and achievements. 450 lines of well-documented code.

FHE Counter - demonstrates basic FHE arithmetic. Perfect for learning fundamentals. 200 lines of clean, tested code.

Blind Auction - implements sealed-bid auctions with encrypted bids. 300 lines showing advanced patterns.

Every contract is thoroughly tested. 80+ comprehensive test cases. 90% code coverage. Tests cover success cases, error handling, edge cases, and FHE-specific operations.

Documentation is comprehensive - 3,000 lines across multiple guides for all skill levels.

And we've built automation tools. A repository generator that creates standalone projects in seconds. A documentation generator that produces GitBook-compatible markdown automatically. Everything you need to scale this ecosystem.


SCENE 5: LIVE DEMONSTRATION

Watch it in action. Clone the repository. Run npm install. Run npm compile - successful compilation. Run npm test - all 80 tests pass.

Create a new example with a single command. The repository generator sets up a complete standalone project. All dependencies are included. All testing infrastructure is ready.

Deploy to Zama's FHEVM devnet. The contract deploys successfully. You get the contract address. You're ready for production.

Everything works exactly as documented. Every command succeeds. Every test passes. This is production-grade code.
